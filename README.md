**MONTY LANGUAGE BYTECODE INTERPRETER MINI-PROJECT**

- This project is intended to use C programming Language to create a mini interpreter for *monty bytecode* using Stack Algorithm Data Structure.

*Monty Language*

Monty 0.98 is a scripting Language. Just like Python, its compiled into bytecodes and then processed for output.

- The function prototypes used in this project are contained in the monty.h file. 

- The interpreter supports different operations such as:

-- Push opcode: pushes an element unto the stack.

-- Pall opcode: prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

-- Pint opcode: prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a newline.

-- Pop opcode: removes the top element of the stack.

-- Swap opcode: swaps the top two elements of the stack.

-- Add opscode: adds the top two element of the stack.

-- Nop opscode: do nothing

-- etc..
